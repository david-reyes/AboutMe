# About Me

2022

I started out as a self-taught app developer, then during Covid times I enrolled at a local community college in their app developer certificate program. A year later I earned two certificates: one for iOS, another for Android.



## MEMS

In my previous career I was the lead MEMS technologist for a string of MEMS-based companies, mostly startups. MEMS is a field in mechanical engineering where structures smaller than the diameter of a human hair are built using silicon. It has a number of applications, mostly in optics. I've been awarded five patents in my field and have written a couple of publications.
