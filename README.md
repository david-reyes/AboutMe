# About Me

First, a little bit about me.

I'm a self-taught iOS app developer by way of Ray Wenderlich. I've read two RW books: Swift Apprentice and iOS Apprentice. I'm currently reading Data Structures & Algorithms, and Server Side Swift with Vapor. I aim to become a full stack developer, and I have hopes of creating and publishing my own apps.

I've built one app, NFL Draftipedia. It's a reference app that lists NFL draft picks by year and by team, with a bio page for each player. It has a search capability. I submitted for it review three times to the App Store, and each time it was rejected for insufficient content and insufficient features. So I added more of each after each rejection, to no avail. I wrote a strong rebuttal after the third rejection: There was once an app in the App Store that did exactly the same thing as my app, which has since been deleted from the App Store due to it no longer being maintained; and my app does what that app did but mine is better. In other words, my app fills a hole in the App Store. I was fortunate enough to warrant a phone call from Apple. They said they no longer accept reference apps, no matter how complete the data set; or how well-curated for the intended audience it might be; and no matter the feature set surrounding it, including a social media component, which was exactly a feature that I intended to include in a later version. It had to have an app experience more meaningful than the value of the data alone, they said.

This was very discouraging to hear. It brought an end to the commercial hopes that I had for the app. (The business model was to sell it for 99c on the App Store.) So I repurposed the app as a portfolio app, to support my efforts in starting a career as an iOS app developer, and this app hopefully showcases my abilities and self-learning determination. The app resides on my GitHub repository. It works, and I'm still developing and adding to it. But I've also moved on to other challenges; namely, server side Swift using Vapor. As I mentioned, I hope to become a full stack developer. It seems only natural to develop both halves if you intend to publish your own apps for commerecial reasons, as I do.

Formerly, I was VP of business develoment for an app startup. We built productivity apps for a large life science company, which was a market leader in deploying apps to enhance their product lines. We built a number of apps for them; one was a sales apps, like Amazon, but exclusively for this company's products like pipettes and viruses. But the most effective app we developed gave app connectivity to one of their laboratory machines, providing remote access and control while an experiment is running. *Every* scientist we spoke to, and I mean *every* scientist, said that remote monitoring changes everything; it provides peace of mind during those super critical experiments where a mistake would be unbearably costly. I felt like we struck gold, a technical solution to an obvious pain point. I played a critical part in getting us to that point; unfortunately, we weren't able to capitalize on the opportunity to its fullest. I quit--amicably, I remain good friends with the cofounder--and the startup shut down soon thereafter.

Though it didn't end how I hoped it would end, I learned the app world from the business side and I found it fascinating. For example, the app world is truly global in ways that few can appreciate. We published an app for this customer and our biggest users were in Germany. The app was written for English speakers. Yes, I know, they speak English in Germany; but still, we did nothing at all to access a market in Germany. And I mean nothing at all. It occurred to me: how many markets can you access without even trying? But how many more can you access if you tried? That's when it dawned on me: I want to try.

And so I was inspired to learn how to code in Swift. I started soon after Swift became open source available, in December 2015, so I count myself as an early adopter. Learning was hard, very hard, at first. But my hopes remain unaffected by the difficulties: I want to create apps that accesses a global user base.

Previously in life, I was the lead MEMS technologist for a string of MEMS-based companies, mostly startups. MEMS is a field in mechanical engineering where structures are built using silicon that are smaller than the diameter of a human hair. I have five patents in my field and a couple of publications. It introduced me to the exciting world of startups, which is where I gravitate and where I thrive.
