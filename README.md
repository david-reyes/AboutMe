# helloWorld
My first GitHub repository

First, a little bit about me.
I'm a solo iOS app developer and full-time stay-at-home dad.
I'm self-taught by way of Ray Wenderlich, several key Swift blogs, and Swift Meetups. I've read two RW books: Swift Apprentice, and iOS Apprentice. I'm currently reading Data Structures & Algorithms, and Server Side Swift with Vapor. I hope to become a full-stack developer, and I have great hopes of creating commercially successful apps. My first attempt didn't go accordig to the script.

I've built one app, NFL Draftipedia. It's a reference app that lists NFL draft picks by year and by team, with a bio page for each player. It has a search capability. I submitted for it review three times to the App Store, and each time it was rejected for insufficient content and insufficent features. So I added more of each after each rejection, to no avail. I wrote a strong rebuttal after the third rejection: There was once an app in the App Store that did exactly the same thing as my app, which has since been deleted from the App Store due to it no longer being maintained; and my app does what that app did but mine is better. In other words, my app fills a hole in the App Store. I was fortunate enough to warrant a phone call from Apple. They said they no longer accept reference apps, no matter how complete the data set; or how well-curated for the intended audience it might be; and no matter the feature set surrounding it, including a social media component, which was exactly a feature that I intended to include in a later version. It had to have an app experience more meaningful than the value of the data alone, they said.

This was very discouraging to hear. It brought an end to "creating commercially successful apps" that was my goal for this app. So I repurposed that app as a portfolio app. It resides on my GitHub repository. It works, and I'm still developing and adding to it.

Previously in life, I was the lead MEMS technologist for several MEMS-based startups. MEMS is a field in mechanical engineering where structures are built that are smaller than the diameter of a human hair. I have five patents in my field and a couple of publications.

markdown uses "hash" characters to map to HTML headings. One hash is H1, two hashes is H2, and so on.
### This is an H3 heading
